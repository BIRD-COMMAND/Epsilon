# Epsilon

[![Build status](https://github.com/TheGuardians/EpsilonPublic/actions/workflows/build.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/TheGuardians/EpsilonPublic/actions)

Epsilon was created out of the need for a GUI to inspect and edit Halo Online cache files, although it also supports any cache file that can be opened with TagTool.

**We are not accepting contributions currently as we are in the progress of migrating to github. The source code is provided as is.**
