### ROADMAP

âœ” TAB and SHIFT+TAB to exit / re-enter the tag tree filter

âœ” visible highlighting for arrow key navigation of tag tree window

âœ” ENTER to open highlighted tag in tag tree

âœ” allow copying blocks between open tags without having to close and reopen them

âœ” separate apply and save button actions on options page

âœ” added startup mod cache option	

âœ” ~~disable keyboard navigation to the info window~~
âœ” completely remove info window
âœ” copy active Cache / Mod Info to clipboard with CTRL+I

âœ” add Poke functionality from Epsilon-Poke application version

ðŸ”œ add Revert \ Undo Poke functionality

ðŸ”œ script window text editing (general improvements, shouldn't be garbage)

ðŸ”œ script window save button should also save the tag

ðŸ”œ script window compile errors should not be garbage

ðŸ”œ intelligent handling for multiple tabs  
(note to self: multiple edittag context for same tag)  
* if tag is already open, switch focus to it
* how can we know with certainty that a tag we're attempting to open is equal to one that's already open?
* add an option to open a "reference" tag - a snapshot / read-only version of the tag

ðŸ”œ show editing context stack per tag  
* or cache? idk exactly how the context works  
* hover a tag or a cache entry to see the stack  

ðŸ”œ arbitrary tag collections
- favorited / pinned tags
- named groups of tags
- open / close / reload / save / 'backup' all tags in a group
- persistent per-group setting to automatically open a group on startup  
(with optional dependency on a specific cache or mod package)

ðŸ”œ intuitive / standardized tab docking and navigation shortcuts
